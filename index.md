# Mapmosphere

 *- envisioning a new collaborative mobile data collection platform*

## About

Maps have been one of the most important discoveries for ages, allowing us present and navigate their way through the world. Now more than ever, as we are heavily relying on digital mapping infrastructure, it is of quality of today's dynamic local knowledge and its freshness has become very crucial.

So as we see that since we're very reliant on mappers who add data to such mapping platforms (as of OpenStreetMap), they deserve a tool that is robust, convenient and rewarding for their work. Through this project campaign, we try to explore the current limitation that mobile device collection apps possess and address it with a simpler solution.

This adds a special advantage in disaster response and readiness all around the world since coordinating with different organization and agencies on site would require a quality local information of the site.

For our history and journey, please keep along the website.

## Idea

Idea is to address limitation of readily available mobile data collection apps:

1. ***Apps lack comfortable means of input systems.***

   Mapping apps were built on top of conventional forms input back then. Now, we have a lot of input system and UX practices to offer the field contributors.

2. ***They lack data validation process.***

   OpenStreetMap requires data to be in technically and logically valid format, this is a difficult issue to address while working on physical premises mapping a lots of places.

   Our intermediate coordination layer (web platform) will supervise the work that is done on field. While the mappers in field have freedom of input format.

3. ***There is no solid recommendation engine that ease their work.***

   Nowadays, we have recommendation systems heaving used in content creation and consumption platforms. Then, why not apply it for humanitarian cause!

   The app is going to have two modes. One is traditional manual one. Second is autopilot mode, where it predicts the input you're going to make in the location based on behavior patterns of previous mappers.
